# SummergeTask
 
## A Couple of Notes  

1. When the code searches for the hotel, it takes some time, so please be patient. It isn't stuck, just slow. ðŸ˜‚  

2. As I stated in the interview, I haven't used Selenium in 2 years, so I had to relearn it almost from scratch while coding this task simultaneously.  

3. Some parts of the code are hardcoded, or I used shortcuts to meet the deadline.  

4. The task had a **2.5-day deadline**, but I was extremely busy these past couple of days. I want to emphasize that this code was very expedited and **not my best work in any way**.  

5. Two asserts are commented out, but you can un-comment them if needed.  

### ðŸš¨ Important Note  
This task has been a **huge challenge** for me, as I had to juggle my work, learn Selenium, and complete this task. I hope you recognize the amount of effort I put into this.  

**Thank you!** ðŸ™Œ
